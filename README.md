Rock Paper Scissors
#####################

Current Issues:
- Problems with sessions on the results page; game.winner always returns nil.


Further functionality to implement:
- Only allow the user to enter the three choices (Rock, Paper, or Scissors). Right now the user can type anything into the submit field.
- Add styling and images to the pages.
- Add a play again button on the results page.
